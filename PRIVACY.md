# Some Details and Commitments

Mutebot only collects the information that is needed to populate your feed and operate the service.

Muted words and following lists are stored against your Bluesky DID. The DID is a string that identifies your Bluesky account (for example. Orthanc's DID is `did:plc:crngjmsdh3zpuhmd5gtgwx6q`). As the administrator, Orthanc does have the ability to look up what words a DID has muted and work out what handle that is, this would only done for purposes of operating and debugging Mutebot. Your DID is public information, anyone can look it up, but this does mean Orthanc won't accidentally see a list of mute words associated with a Bluesky handle.

Mutebot is a project provided for the good of the community. The data captured will not be sold or shared. The project will not be sold.

If costs get out of hand in future or Orthanc is unable to keep operating this for other reasons the current Mutebot will be shut down rather than access given to another individual or organisation.

If there is still need for a Mutebot at that time, the project is open source and another individual or organisation can stand it up allowing people to choose whether they wish to trust another party with their data.
